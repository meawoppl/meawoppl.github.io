# Welcome to My Blog

I've decided to add a blog section to my personal website to share thoughts, project updates, and technical musings. This is the first post to test out the new functionality.

## What to Expect

I plan to write about:

- Technical projects and maker adventures
- Burning Man art installations and experiences
- Programming insights and tools
- Random thoughts on technology and creativity

## Recent Work

I've been busy with various projects lately, from metal working to software development. You can check out my full portfolio for visual documentation of past work.

Stay tuned for more posts!
