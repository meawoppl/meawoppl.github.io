    <h3>Here are some things I have done:</h3>

    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <em><a href="http://www.3scan.com">3Scan</a></em> is a company I founded.  It's full of great people
            and it is a force in the bio-entropy war.
        </li>

        <li>
          <em><a href="http://coupdefoud.re">Coup de Foudre</a></em> is a group of
            artists, scientists, engineers, and mathmeticians.  We build large tesla
            coils and other exotic high-power art.
            We do events at museums, Burning Man, and other venues.  
        </li>

        <li>
          <em><a href="https://medium.com/@meawoppl">Medium</a></em>
            is a place I occasionally write about the above and
            other topics too numerous to mention.

    <h2>Some things I am interested in doing more of:</h2>

    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <em>Plasma Physics</em> specifically computational modeling and numerical
            control approaches to plasma control.  Along side this comes a healthy 
            interest in high power electronics and fusion.
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>Generative PCB design</em>, I love the idea of getting computers to do
            more of the heavy lifting on circuit design/layout.  I have written
            <a href="https://github.com/meawoppl/babyfood"> my own EDA software</a>
            to facilitate some strange designs.
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>Computational Photography</em> of the 5d lightfield that we all know and love.
            This includes satellite photography, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxnociXGMIQ"> time-lapse</a>,
            IR/UV photography, super-macro, high-speed, and low light.  I love my Sony a7SII.
            I have done more Canon hacking than is probably legal.
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>Rail guns</em>, <a href="http://www.smbc-comics.com/?id=2722">because hoverbike.</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
