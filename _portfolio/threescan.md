I spent a bit more than 8 years working on 3Scan. I served as the CTO and software leader.
It is one of the things I am proudest of and
happiest with.  With its merger into [Strateos](https://strateos.com/) I felt as though I had experienced the whole startup life arc.

The tech was challenging.  We built some incredible things in hardware, software, and [squishware](https://trademarks.justia.com/873/56/squishware-87356821.html) alike. While [published](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C5&q=3scan&btnG=),
made the [news](https://news.google.com/search?q=3scan), and generally prospered, 
the thing I am most proud of is the team.

For them, I would do it again in a heartbeat.
