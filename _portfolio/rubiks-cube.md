Sometime in 2014 I became obsessed with [Rubik's Cubes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubik%27s_Cube)
In particular, I was interested in better understanding the Group Theory that went into them,
and other permutation puzzles.  

I spent some time studying the design/assembly of existing puzzles before designing my own.  The
core motivation was that all current embodiments required components with inherent asymmetry, more
specifically the symmetry of the cube itself was less than that of the actual
[Rubik's cube group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubik%27s_Cube_group).

This design fixes that my making the center a ball bearing, and the pieces connect via magnets.

My [partner](http://ruzamarkov.com/) at the time (a talented computational geometer) 
made my sketches reality using the [OpenCascade](https://github.com/meawoppl/occplay)
and the [Plethora](https://www.plethora.com/) machine shop.

The all metal cube weighs more than 2kg, and requires some effort to work.
