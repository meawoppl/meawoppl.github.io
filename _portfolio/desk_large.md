Occasionally a project comes finding the ideal material.  I discovered this
piece of wood in a trip to a hardware store in Humbolt.  I imagined it as a
desk where the cords could drop through the center of the burl.

The project felt much like an homage to my recently passed grandfather, whose
tools figured prominently into the processing of this wood into a finished piece
of furniture.
