Theophany was a [Burning Man Honrorarium](https://burningman.org/culture/history/brc-history/event-archives/2019-event-archive/2019-art-installations/) art project to combine the elemental forces of
fire and lightening. Over the course of 6 months we took it from a napkin sketch
to a completed art piece consisting of over a ton of glass, steel, and electronics.

This was [Coup de Foudre's](http://coupdefoud.re) first propane project and incredibly
exciting to see come together.

I missed the final build due to an inconveniently timed organ failure,
but the team sent me these while I recovering from having my appendix removed.
