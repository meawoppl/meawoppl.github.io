Theophany was a Burning Man funded art project to combine the elemental forces of
fire and lightening.  Over the course of 6 months I lead it from a napkin sketch
to a completed art piece consisting of over a ton of glass, steel, and electronics.

I was unfortunately not able to be there for the final build, but the crew sent these
back while I was having my appendix removed.
