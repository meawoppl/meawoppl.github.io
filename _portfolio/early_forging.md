Sometime in the early 2000's I got into metalwork.

Myself and small group of freinds built casting and blacksmithing equipment.
I thank my hugely permissive parents whose driveway was frequently graced
by emprovised and frankly sketchy flammable gas buring equipment desinged and
built by high-schoolers.
