Sometime in early 2014 I became interested in the [Book of Kells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Kells)
and more generally [illuminated manuscripts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illuminated_manuscript).

I was keen to gain access to the source imagery, as I had a few different image processing projects in mind
that required their input as a feedstock. I wrote a utility, first in [Python](https://github.com/meawoppl/BookOfKells),
and later [Java](https://github.com/meawoppl/monastic) to retrieve these works, and convert them
into digitally accessible local resources.

I spent quite an amount of marveling over the illumination, rubication, and patterns contained before realizing
something harrowing.

I had inadvertency participated in the monastic tradition itself. The practice of my craft had 
resulted in a reproduction and continuation of a manuscript.
