During my masters degree process I took on leading a project with the Students for the
Exploration and Development of Spave (SEDS).  The goal was ambitious, to build a
[Rockoon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rockoon).

Lets be clear, from an practical perspective this is a downright bad way to get
a rocket into space.  It was however a fanstastic project to get undergrads excited,
and presented a range of engineering challenges.

Most of my work as the group leader involved paperwork for the FAA, shaking down department heads
for money, and getting folks the right tools do what excites them.  This would become a repeated
pattern in my life.
