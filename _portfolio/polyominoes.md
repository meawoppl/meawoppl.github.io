Mid 2014 I was introduced to the generalization of a set of shapes we are all 
aware of.  For n=2, we call them dominos, for n=4 we call them Tetris pieces.

It is pretty easy to work your way through up to about n=5 by hand, but the number of unique
entries goes up quite quickly.

Beyond 10 modern broswers begin to struggle to render correctly.  These are the shapes for 
n=12 and n=14. To see them correctly you may have to open the image directly or in a new tab.

This was a fun little project to undertake.
