Mid 2014 I was introduced to the generalization of a set of shapes we are all 
aware of.  For n=2, we call them dominos, for n=4 we call them Tetris pieces.

The shapes you converge on a given number of squares contained
are called [Polyominos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyomino). 
It is pretty easy to work your way through up to about n=5 by hand, but the number of unique
entries goes up quite quickly.  n=8 and n=10 are below.

Beyond 10 modern browsers begin to struggle to render correctly. [The last image in this set is for n=14.](/images/polyn/up_to_14.png)
To see them correctly you may have to open the image directly or in a new tab.
This is a 200 megapixel image, so give extend your computer some sympathy.
