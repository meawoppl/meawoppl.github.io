One of the earliest engineering projects I undertook was in conjunction with a childhood friend.
Together we designed, and built a pair of controllers for the then immensely popular game 
[Dance Dance Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dance_Dance_Revolution)

The game pads featured several things that weren't available on the commercial market:
* Sheet metal finish.  This was substantially closer to the texture and feel of the arcade (competition) controls.
* Modular design.  Each pad could break apart into 3 pieces for greatly simplified transport
* Welded base. This was essential to meet the durability and longevity needed for this grueling application.

In retrospect this was quite a challenge from a human interface design perspective.  Building a
interaction surface that interfaced with existing console gaming systems and met our needs for transportation
and durability was quite daunting!
