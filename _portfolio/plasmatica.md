Plasmatica is [Coup De Foudre](http://coupdefoud.re) project lead by Mike Murphy.  It
brought together CDF's knowledge of high-voltage electronics with the work of neon
artists to make playful interactive show plasma, the lest often experienced 4th phase of matter.

While the exhibit was initially [crafted for Burning Man](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/327342610/plasmatica-the-hidden-life-of-ions/posts/2259226) It took has seen adventures at museums and other venues
where interactive art is appreciated.

This was the first year we incorporated as a formal business structure, and much of my contribution was
wangling the formation a 501c3.  This was a long process, but ultimately let us have better
access to people and organizations who want to support artistic scientific endeavors such as our group
enjoys creating.
