Thanks to some incredible work by the [3Scan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3Scan) team we
were invited to exhibit our work at the [V&A Museum](https://www.vam.ac.uk/)
in London. The exhibit titled ["The Future Starts Here"](https://www.vam.ac.uk/articles/about-the-future-starts-here-exhibition)
focused on how the changing landscape of technology was altering the human 
experience.
