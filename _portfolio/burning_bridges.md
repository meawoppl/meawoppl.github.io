Just after moving to Austin I got tangled up with the [Flipside](https://www.burningflipside.com/)
arts community. The theme for the event they were building for was "Bad Idea"

The goal of the architect was to embody a yoga pose of two female figures supporting a
bridge.  The [local hackerspace](http://atxhs.org/wiki/Main_Page) I worked with had just gotten
a [kinect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinect), which I eagerly turned into a tool for 3d scanning.

With a fair bit of (manual) post processing we produced a mesh we were able to use to guide CNC
plywood cutting and finally construction.

This was a huge collaboration with the Austin DAFT crew, many of whom I keep in touch with
to this day. Then in the tradition of our people, [we set our work on fire and watched it
burn.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z61f-xAO4Rk)

[HackADay](https://hackaday.com/2011/06/08/create-and-conflagrate-giant-modeled-sculptures-with-kinect-and-cnc/) wrote a thing about it!

Here is some of the crew that made this all happen.
