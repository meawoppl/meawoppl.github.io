Sometime in early high-school I got the itch to make a robot. I didn't quite
know what that meant then, but the thing that came out of this desire was a
sort of telepresense robot.

The car streamed (analog!) video signal over radio. It had a pair of servos
which could point the camera and help it to manuever over complex terrain
and chase neighborhood dogs. These days this might be labeled as a "drone", but
at the time, we were just trying to play.
