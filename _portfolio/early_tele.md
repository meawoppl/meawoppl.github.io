Sometime in early high-school I got the itch to make a robot.  I didn't quite
know what that meant then, but the thing that came out of this desire was a
sort of telepresense robot.

The car streamed (analog!) video signal over radio.  It had a pair of servos
which could point the camera and help it to manuever over complex terrain
and chase neighborhood dogs.  Quite a bit of systems integration work was
needed to make this all come together.
