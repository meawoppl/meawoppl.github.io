Piggybacking off of the success of the last years [Orage project](/portfolio/orage.html)
I lead [Coup De Foudre](https://www.coupdefoud.re/) in transforming some of the existing
hardware into an up close tactile experience in stark contrast to the loud and brash project
of last year.

Special work was done to limit the power, and shape particular signals which allowed
people to play in and experience high voltage fields with their friends.

It is cheesy to say that you have to experience something first hand, but this
is an experience designed to connect people with a visceral sensation of
electricity.  I was delighted to see people touch, play, and interact in new ways.
**This is strictly something that has no day-to-day comparable experiences.**

This would not have been possible without the CDF crew.
