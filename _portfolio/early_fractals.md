name: Early Work 2/4 - Fractals
---

I have had a long love for fractals.  Some of the earliest code that I wrote was made to
render and experiment with them.  A childhood conspirator and I used a bootleg copy of MSV6
to explore this world, and more generally learn some math along the way.  I even brought some
of these learnings to culinary adventures

It was my first adventure of many into the world of mathematics.
