I have had a long love for fractals. In my freshman year in highschool I joined forces
with a childhood conspirator to learn more about them. We used a bootleg copy of MSVC6
to explore this world, implemented code for the handling of [complex numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number),
and generally learned quite a bit of math along the way. We even brought some
of these learnings to culinary adventures

It was my first adventure of many into the world of mathematics, and also
first collaborative software project!
