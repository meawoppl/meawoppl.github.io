Early in highschool, a passionate friend taugh me how to weld. I was hooked
on metalwork ever since. A group of us got together and built a propane
forge and foundry setup.

There is something lovely and primitive about the way that fire draws a group
together. We would routinely host metalwork nights in my parents driveway
where we would pound steel and cast aluminum.

I am hugely thankful to my permissive parents who tolerated improvised and 
sketchy flammable gas burning equipment so near our home.
