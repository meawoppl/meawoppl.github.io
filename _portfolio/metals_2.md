Eventually I brought together two of my big passions.  Metals and computation.
I earned a masters degree while working on solidification and fluids simulation
as it related to the casting process.

This are some rendering I created of a solidification simulation.

One of the experiments that I worked on the most was part of NASA/ESA collaboration
called MICAST/CETSOL.  The goal was to better understand the behavior of alloys
in the absence of convection driven flow, a byproduct of microgravity.
