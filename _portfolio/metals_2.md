Eventually I brough together two of my bid passions.  Metals and computation.
I earned a masters degree while working on solidification and fluids simulation
as it related to the casting process.

This are some rendering I created of a solidification simulation.

One of the experiments that I worked on the most was part of NASA/ESA collaboraion
called MICAST CETSOL.  The goal was to better understand the behaviour of alloys
in the absense of convection driven flow, a byproduct of microgravity.
