Eventually I brought together two of my big passions.  Metals and computation.
I earned a masters degree while working on solidification and fluids simulation
as it related to the casting process.

The experiments related to this all were part of NASA/ESA collaboration called MICAST/CETSOL.
Eventually my results were used to run an experiment on the ISS in the capable hands of
[Frank De Winne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_De_Winne).

The goal was to better understand the behavior of alloys
in the absence of convection driven flow, a byproduct of microgravity.
