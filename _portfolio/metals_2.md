<h1> {{page.name}} </h1>

During my Masters degree, I brought together two of my big passions, metals and computation.
I worked with the Erdmann Research Group on solidification and fluids simulation
as it related to the casting process.

The experiments were part of NASA/ESA collaboration called MICAST/CETSOL.
Eventually my results were used to run small furnace on the ISS in the capable hands of
[Frank De Winne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_De_Winne).

The goal was to better understand the behavior of alloys in the absence of convection driven flow,
a byproduct of microgravity. My role in this group was simulation of physical phenemenon, and
generation of interpretable visualizations explain the results.
