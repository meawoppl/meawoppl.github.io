Early 2014 I stated getting a little itchy to do something in electronics.
I had learned from a friend that the way [PCBs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printed_circuit_board)
were made was just a bit of an old-timey graphics language. 

Enjoying graphics and geometry I felt more than up to the challenge.  After a few days of
coding, a test run to quantify precision, and some help a [geometry collaborator](http://ruzamarkov.com/projects/circulation/)
we submitted the following design:

The manufacturer contacted me the next day to tell me three things:
* The board design met all of their DFM rules, but they were not sure it could be manufactured
* The design was significantly underquoted, because they had never tested the case of a board with only circular contours
* They were willing to *try* make it at the quoted price all the same

I said go for it, and I was not at all disappointed.

Much love to [OSHPark](https://oshpark.com) for their great work and continued support of my wacky designs!
