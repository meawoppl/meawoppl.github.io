The Singing Coils was another [Coup De Foudre](http://coupdefoud.re) project I helped make happen.
It leveraged CDF's knowledge of high-voltage to build a truly different acoustic experience than
Tesla Coils typically provide.

Using a special frequency modulation approach, we were able to produce incredibly high-fidelity
sound. To my knowledge this has never been done before, and is quite electrically unique!

These coils lent themselves to unique acoustic compositions from our group, as well as an
impromptu violin performance, which was really something very special.
