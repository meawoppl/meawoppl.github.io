In early 2018, [my partner](https://twitter.com/TweetAnnaMarie) and I pickled up a lovely
slab of wood from an Arcata lumber yard.  We split it into two pieces, 
then applied quite a bit of human labor to bring them into shape.

Over the course of a dozen or so short work days we planed and sanded it into a shape we were happy with.
Anna Marie welded, ground, and painted the the base.
We assembled it and transported it to our new home almost a year after we had first gotten the slab.

The final result was worth the effort.
