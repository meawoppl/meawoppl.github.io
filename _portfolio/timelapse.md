Sometime in August 2011 I was given my first "real" camera, about 3 weeks later I
left it on a mountainside. Thankfully this wasn't an accident, myself and a number
of collaborators had carefully chosen a location to leave it, direction it was pointed,
and jerry-rigged two car batteries and a solar charger to support its purpose.

Over the course of the next 5 weeks the camera would take just shy of 9000 photos,
in the middle of that time, and the center of the frame, was the Burning Man event.

The above image is one of the neat byproducts of the set of images, a fusion between a 
night shot of the man burning, and a calm morning with raking sun angle.

Ultimately we compiled these photos into a video, which something like a half-million
people saw!

This viewership was largely fueled by
[Petapixel](https://petapixel.com/2011/10/14/mesmerizing-time-lapse-of-burning-man-shows-5-weeks-in-5-minutes/) and
[Gawker](https://gawker.com/5849545%2Fthe-craziness-of-burning-man-in-5-minutes) doing bits on our work.

Here are a few of the people who helped hike, drag up equipment, and swap SD cards as needed.
